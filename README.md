# Project Overview
Companies frequently employ customer segmentation models to categorize their clients into distinct user groups, where each group comprises customers who exhibit common characteristics setting them apart from other users.

Within this project, my tasks entailed data preparation for customer segmentation and the construction of a K-Means algorithm from the ground up. Additionally, I delved into the implementation of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis in marketing to assess customer value and explored alternative metrics for evaluating the clustering algorithm's effectiveness. Lastly, I addressed the matter of visualizing and interpreting clusters to facilitate customer segmentation.

# Prerequisites
I used E-Commerce Dataset from Kaggle that contains transaction information from around 4,000 customers. Also, I had the following libraries installed — Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Kneed, and Scipy.
